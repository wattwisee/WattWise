# WattWise

WattWise is an electricity usage dashboard that helps users monitor daily power consumption, estimate monthly electricity bills, and compare usage trends over time.

It uses the Gemini API to perform intelligent calculations, generate usage statistics, and suggest ways to reduce electricity bills. The Google Maps API detects the user’s location to identify the correct electricity provider, ensuring accurate, personalized billing estimates for the Philippine market.

To stay current, WattWise gathers real-time pricing data from major providers such as Meralco through web scraping. Users receive notifications when electricity rates change, helping them make informed decisions about their energy consumption.

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
